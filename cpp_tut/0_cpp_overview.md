## 0.1 Statements

This note is mainly adapted from what I have recorded from my CSC3002 study. Rather than a complete tutorial (which could be easy to find within the useful materials mentioned below), it works as a listing of C++ knowledge, which could be useful for a general review. With these notes, I hope:

+ Students could get a linear knowledge of the C++ landscape, instead of slices of topics.

+ Students could quickly grasp what would appear in the final examination in a very quick review.

+ Students could spend more time working with projects, especially for a practical language course like this.
+ Students could learn more about STL, new features of C++ (especially C++11), etc.

With these wishes I drafted this note, which is simplified, precise and conclusive, although it might be too concise. Hence, attendance to lectures or careful reading through the textbook is still a must. The keys for exercises in the textbook has been provided by a former USTF, accessble [here]().

In this or later edition, I will recommend practice projects with high quality. The codes within the course are far from enough, and these high-quality projects with answers will offer a chance for you to apply your knowledge and integrate multiple skills into a fruitful outcome.

Also I extend with some supplement for what is only briefly mentioned in the course. They will be marked with the mark **(*)**, and is provided as a reference for further study.

Hope every one of you have fun with C++!

## 0.3 Useful Materials

Here are some materials I find useful during my study:

* Stanford CS106L: Mainly focus on [Course-reader](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/full_course_reader.pdf). Though a bit old-fashioned, it is still a good reader (provided in 2010), which is detailed enough for a clear understanding.

* Stanford CS106X: If you insist to make use of the materials, these are accessible:  [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOyyGQU_ErA&list=PLoCMsyE1cvdVmbGH6Jp-9twXPbi5J_IBT&index=1) from 2017 Autumn, and [resources](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106x/index.html) from 2019 Autumn. If you do not have sufficient time, just read our textbook!

* *Programming Abstractions in C++*: Our textbook,  accessible [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106x/res/reader/CS106BX-Reader.pdf).

* *C++ Primer*: A classic C++ manual, accessible [here](https://zhjwpku.com/assets/pdf/books/C++.Primer.5th.Edition_2013.pdf).

* Official C/C++ reference: I always use it as a dictionary, which is accesseible [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/).

## 0.4 Notation

Here are notations and symbols with specific meanings:

+ *Italics*: Used for specific terminology.
+ **Bold**: Highlights key content.
+ ***Bold Italics***: Emphasizes crucial concepts that involve specific terminology, especially when introduced for the first time.
+ [Hyperlink](https://cplusplus.com/): Directs to external resources or references.
+ Bug icon (temporarily `ERR`): Indicates the presence of a bug.

## 0.5 Acknowledgements

This note is heavily reliant on [Prof. HUANG, Rui](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/huangrui)'s course: **CSC3002 (C/C++ Programming)**, offered at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). Also I have referred to materials like Stanford CS106L, official C++ documents and others.

Through the writing of the work, I get direct or indirect support from faculties, my **CHEN** and my good friends like **DONG**, **GUO** and **JIN**. Highly appreciate it for their time and devotions.
