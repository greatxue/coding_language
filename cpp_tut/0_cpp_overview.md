# 0. Overview

## 0.1 Statements

This note is mainly adapted from what I have recorded from my CSC3002 study. Rather than a complete tutorial (which could be easy to find within the useful materials mentioned below), it works as a listing of C++ knowledge, which could be useful for a general review. For this reason, some comments of the implementation has been removed as well.

Also, in the subpages I extend with some supplement for what is only briefly mentioned in the course. Hope it works as a seed, which broadens the readers' horizon and inspires them for further explorations. 

At the end of the note, I will also recommend practice projects with high quality. It will offer a chance for you to apply your knowledge and integrate multiple skills into a fruitful outcome!

## 0.6 Acknowledgements

This note is heavily reliant on [Prof. HUANG, Rui](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/huangrui)'s course: **CSC3002 (C/C++ Programming)**, offered at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). In the process of writing, I have also referred to materials like Stanford CS106L, official C++ documents and other references.

The materials have been kindly reviewed by my good friends like **DONG, Haoze** and **JIN, Zhengda**. Highly appreciate it for their time and devotions.
