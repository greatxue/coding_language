# 15.1 STL Containers

The STL is logically divided into six pieces, each consisting of components correlated with the rest of the library:

+ **Containers:** At the heart of the STL are a collection of container classes, where you can store elements in several organizaitions.

+ **Iterators:** Each STL container exports iterators that view and modify ranges of stored data. Iterators have a common interface allowing arbitrary operations.

+ **Algorithms:** STL algorithms are functions that operate over ranges of data specified by iterators.

+ **Adapters:** STL adapters are objects which transform an object from one form into another. 

+ **Functors:** Because so much of the STL relies on user-defined callback functions, the STL provides facilities for creating and modifying functions at runtime. 

+ **Allocators:** The STL allows clients of the container classes to customize how memory is allocated and deallocated.
